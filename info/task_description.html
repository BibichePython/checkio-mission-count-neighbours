    Many board games are played with rectangular grid with squares as cells.
    And for some games is important to know about neighbour cells for a chip (figure, draught etc).
</p>

<p>
    You are given a state of a rectangular grid with chips as a binary matrix,
    where 1 is a cell with a chip and 0 is an empty cell.
    And you are given a coordinates of a cell as row and column numbers (starting from 0).
    You should how many chips are near this cell.
    Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
    which are cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

</p>

<p>
    For the given examples (see the schema) there is the same grid:
</p>
<pre>
((1, 0, 0, 1, 0),
 (0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
 (0, 0, 1, 0, 1),
 (1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
 (0, 0, 1, 0, 0),)

</pre>
<p>
    For the first example coordinates of the cell is (1, 2) and as we can see from the schema this
    cell has 3 neighbour chips. For the second example coordinates is (0, 0) and this cell contains
    a chip, but we count only neighbours and the answer is 1.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Three arguments. A grid as a tuple of tuples wit integers (1/0),
    a row number and a column number of a cell as integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> How many neighbours cells have chips as an integer.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    As we already said in the begining it can be useful for board games algorithms.
    And it can be useful for navigational software.
